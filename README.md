Task-5 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)| ELEVATE LABS Data Analytics Internship | Date 30 June , 2025 | Author Sarvesh Kumar
📝Objective
The objective of this task was to clean ,manipulate and find the insights .
"The objective of this task is to explore and analyze the Titanic dataset to understand the key factors that influenced passenger survival, clean the data, visualize important trends, and extract actionable insights that can be used for future predictive modeling or decision-making."
Understand the Structure and Quality of the Data
Identify data types, missing values, and data distributions.
Clean the data by handling null values and removing irrelevant columns like Cabin.
Gain Insights into Passenger Demographics and Behavior
Analyze how features like age, sex, ticket class, and embarkation port relate to survival.
Explore patterns and trends that might influence outcomes (e.g., survival).
✅ Outcomes of the Titanic Dataset EDA Task
After performing thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, the following key outcomes were achieved:

📊 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
Cabin column dropped due to excessive missing values.

Missing values in Age filled with median age.

Missing values in Embarked filled with mode.

Dataset is now clean and ready for analysis or modeling.

🔍 2. Key Insights Discovered
🚻 Gender & Survival
Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.

👶 Age Patterns
Majority of passengers were aged 20–40.

Children had slightly higher survival, indicating priority during rescue.

💰 Fare Impact
Higher fare correlated with higher survival rates, especially in 1st class.

🧳 Embarkation Port
Passengers from Cherbourg (C) had a higher survival rate than those from Southampton or Queenstown.

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family Size (SibSp/Parch)
Traveling with 1–2 family members increased survival.

Very large families or solo travelers had lower survival rates.

📈 3. Feature Relationships Identified
Survival was most strongly correlated with: Sex, Pclass, Fare, and Parch.

These features can be considered important predictors for building a survival prediction model.

🧠 4. Actionable Insights
Gender, class, and fare are crucial factors to consider in survival prediction.

Data is now EDA-ready for Machine Learning tasks (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees).

🧾 Summary Statement:
The EDA uncovered significant survival patterns linked to gender, class, and fare. With the data cleaned and key variables identified, the dataset is now ready for predictive modeling or deeper statistical analysis.
